# Symyn

[View the project on carvacodes.github.io](https://carvacodes.github.io/?project=symyn).

A modern clone of the classic "Simon" game, using the HTML5 `AudioContext` API for sound. Use either the mouse, WASD, or the numpad to play.

I added a title screen to force the user to press a button to interact, since some mobile devices will not allow `AudioContext` sounds to fire without user input to drive them.
